# Introduction

A $\textbf{frieze pattern}$ is a type of wallpaper pattern that exhibits translational symmetry along one direction. It is named after the decorative band (frieze) commonly found in architecture and classical art. Frieze patterns are characterized by repeating motifs that are translated (shifted) in a straight line, creating an infinite strip of symmetry.

Here are some key characteristics of frieze patterns:

$\textbf{Translational Symmetry}$: The defining feature of a frieze pattern is its translational symmetry. The pattern repeats itself along one direction, usually horizontally, without any gaps or overlaps.

$\textbf{Infinite Strip}$: Frieze patterns can be thought of as an infinite strip of the repeated motif. The strip extends indefinitely in one direction.

$\textbf{Symmetry Operations}$: The symmetry operations involved in frieze patterns are translations. The motifs are translated by a certain distance to generate the repetition.

$\textbf{Classification}$: Frieze patterns can be classified based on the types of symmetries present. Common classifications include p (vertical reflection), pm (horizontal translation), pg (glide reflection), cm (180-degree rotation), and pmm (vertical reflection with a vertical translation).

$\textbf{Mathematical Representation}$: Frieze patterns can be mathematically represented using functions, matrices, or geometric transformations. For example, matrix operations can be employed to describe the translational symmetries.

$\textbf{Applications}$: Frieze patterns have applications in various fields, including art, design, and mathematics. They are used in decorative arts, architecture, and can be studied for their mathematical properties.

Frieze patterns are part of a broader classification of two-dimensional patterns, which includes wallpaper patterns and the more general concept of crystallographic or symmetry groups. They play a significant role in both mathematical research and artistic design.

A $\textbf{frieze pattern or border pattern}$ is a pattern that extends to the left and right in such a way that the pattern can be mapped onto itself by a horizontal translation. In addition to being mapped onto itself by a horizontal translation, some frieze patterns can be mapped onto themselves by other transformations.

$\textbf{The seven frieze groups}$

1.  p1: T (translation only, in the horizontal direction)

2.  p1m1: TV (translation and vertical line reflection)

3.  p11m: THG (translation, horizontal line reflection, and glide reflection)

4.  p11g: TG (translation and glide reflection)

5.  p2: TR (translation and 180° rotation)

6.  p2mg: TRVG (translation, 180° rotation, vertical line reflection, and glide reflection)

7.  p2mm: TRHVG (translation, 180° rotation, horizontal line reflection, vertical line reflection, and glide reflection)

# Summary
Understanding frieze patterns often involves concepts from group theory, a branch of mathematics that studies symmetries and transformations. Mathematicians like John Conway have contributed to the classification and notation of frieze patterns, making it easier to describe and analyze these repeating structures.

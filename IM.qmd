# Introduction

A $\textbf{frieze pattern or border pattern}$ is a pattern that extends to the left and right in such a way that the pattern can be mapped onto itself by a horizontal translation. In addition to being mapped onto itself by a horizontal translation, some frieze patterns can be mapped onto themselves by other transformations.

$\textbf{The seven frieze groups}$

1.  p1: T (translation only, in the horizontal direction)

2.  p1m1: TV (translation and vertical line reflection)

3.  p11m: THG (translation, horizontal line reflection, and glide reflection)

4.  p11g: TG (translation and glide reflection)

5.  p2: TR (translation and 180° rotation)

6.  p2mg: TRVG (translation, 180° rotation, vertical line reflection, and glide reflection)

7.  p2mm: TRHVG (translation, 180° rotation, horizontal line reflection, vertical line reflection, and glide reflection)
